1. Define Criteria for Undervalued Stocks
Before building, decide how you'll define "undervalued":

Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio – Compare stocks with industry averages.

Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio – Identify stocks trading below book value.

Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis – Estimate intrinsic value.

Relative Strength Index (RSI) – Identify oversold stocks.

Market Capitalization & Debt Levels – Look at financial health.

Dividend Yield – Ensure long-term value potential.

2. Data Collection
Fetch real-time and historical stock data using yfinance.

Access fundamental metrics via Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage API.

Store data in a database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, or Pandas DataFrames).

3. Analysis & Screening
Implement financial models to compare stocks against benchmarks.

Apply machine learning for pattern recognition (optional).

Use thresholds for undervaluation detection.

4. Portfolio Optimization
Suggest stocks with growth potential & low risk.

Implement sector diversification strategies.

Track historical performance trends.

5. Visualization & UI
Create interactive dashboards using Streamlit or Flask.

Show stock screening results with charts & tables.

Allow users to filter and customize criteria.

6. Automation & Alerts
Set up email alerts or notifications for new undervalued stocks.

Automate periodic stock scans with scheduled updates.

Integrate with brokerage APIs for seamless tracking.

7. Deployment & Scaling
Host the app on AWS, Heroku, or Google Cloud.

Ensure data security and optimize performance.

1️⃣Fetch Stock Data

Retrieve historical price trends and fundamental data.

Get the latest news and financial reports.

2️⃣ Calculate Intrinsic Value

Use discounted cash flow (DCF), price-to-earnings (P/E), and other valuation metrics.

Compare intrinsic value to the current market price.

3️⃣ Detect Market Anomalies

Use historical price analysis to find unusual movements (e.g., large price drops).

Apply Z-score, moving averages, or Bollinger Bands to identify mispricings.

4️⃣ Validate Buy Opportunity

If stock is undervalued by intrinsic value AND anomalies confirm a buying opportunity → ✅ Potential Buy Signal!

If stock is fairly valued but anomaly suggests temporary mispricing, consider a short-term trade opportunity.

If anomaly shows extreme volatility or risks, re-evaluate before buying.

5️⃣ Execute Strategy

Final risk assessment (market conditions, earnings reports, sector trends).

Decide on entry point, stop-loss, and position sizing.

Monitor performance & adjust strategy dynamically as new anomalies emerge


------These will work good for short term trading---------


1️⃣ Retrieve Historical Price Data
Use yfinance to fetch price movements over a specific period.

Calculate daily returns to detect anomalies.

2️⃣ Apply Z-score for Anomaly Detection
Compute Z-score on daily returns to flag unusual price movements.

Define an anomaly threshold (e.g., |Z-score| > 2 for extreme movements).

3️⃣ Calculate RSI to Confirm Market Momentum
Use RSI (14-day window) to gauge whether a stock is overbought (>70) or oversold (<30).

When an anomaly (Z-score) is detected, check RSI to see if the market is in a buying zone.

4️⃣ Validate Entry Signals
BUY Signal: When Z-score < -2 (price drops abnormally) AND RSI < 30 (oversold condition) → Potential undervalued entry point.

SELL Signal: When Z-score > 2 (price spikes abnormally) AND RSI > 70 (overbought condition) → Potential exit point before reversal.

5️⃣ Visualize the Signals
Use Seaborn to plot price trends, RSI, and Z-score anomalies.

Highlight buy/sell zones using different colors.

6️⃣ Optimize & Test Your Model
Backtest the strategy using historical data.

Adjust thresholds dynamically based on market conditions


----------Final take for the program-------------


✅ Long-Term Focus:

Investors typically use intrinsic value and fundamental analysis, but anomalies can refine entry points when stocks are temporarily mispriced.

Z-score helps detect extreme price drops for undervalued stocks.

RSI confirms oversold conditions, signaling a good buying opportunity for long-term gains.

⚠️ Considerations:

Stock prices don't move as fast as forex, so anomalies may be less frequent.

Best for value investing & swing trading (rather than scalping or day trading).

💰 For Forex (Currency Trading)
✅ Short-Term Focus:

Z-score detects sudden spikes/drops due to economic news (e.g., interest rate changes).

RSI helps confirm trend exhaustion, signaling reversals or breakout trades.

Works well with momentum-based strategies, such as catching trends before reversals.

⚠️ Considerations:

Forex markets move faster, meaning anomalies may appear more frequently than in stocks.

Pairing it with additional indicators (e.g., MACD or Bollinger Bands) can improve accuracy.

🔥 Final Verdict:
Your program CAN work for both investing and forex, but you’ll need to adjust the strategy:

For stocks → Focus more on intrinsic value + Z-score confirmation.

For forex → Use Z-score & RSI for rapid trend detection & reversals.
